Many car owners struggle to understand the meaning of alerts and error signals displayed on their car dashboards. This confusion often leads them to search the internet for information, which can be time-consuming and unreliable due to the vast amount of inconsistent or incorrect data available online. Additionally, traditional car manuals are not user-friendly for quick reference, and not everyone is comfortable navigating them.
This application offers a streamlined and user-friendly solution through a RAG-powered chatbot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This chatbot provides reliable, verified information on car dashboard alerts, making it easy for users to understand what their car is signaling.
